# RAG Advanced Techniques: Complete Codebase & Research 🔍📚

A powerful and structured repository exploring **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** — from basic implementations to **advanced techniques** and **research-backed experiments**. Future updates will include **multimodal RAG** (text + image).

---

## 🧠 About This Project

This repository serves as both a **learning resource** and a **research-oriented codebase** for understanding and implementing RAG techniques.  
It provides hands-on examples, custom retriever-generator setups, integration with vector databases, search systems, and curated notes from relevant academic papers.

The goal is to make this repo a go-to reference for mastering RAG — whether you're an ML enthusiast, researcher, or engineer.
